# Where did you find my token?
It was on a public platform like Replit or something similar

# What did you do to my token?
I have collected information about it and added it to my database and then invalidated it. Nothing more, nothing less

# Did you hack into my account?
I did not. 

# Why did you "steal" my token?
I did not. I helped you by making it invalid so people that do the same thing as me, but with an evil purpose don't abuse your token

# How did you get so many tokens?
I keep that private as to not guide malicious people into doing the same

# Got more questions?
Reach me at lily[@]blahaj.shop or unknown.#0001.
